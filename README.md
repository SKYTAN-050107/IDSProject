# Introduction to Data Science WIE2003 project
-Spotify global music trend prediction
### Introduction
- To model global music trend predictions using machine learning algorithms
- Key problems 
1.What features or factors (e.g., tempo, genre, artist popularity, region) most strongly influence the rise of music trends globally?
2.Can machine learning models be trained to predict which songs, genres, or artists are likely to trend in the near future based on historical and real-time data?
3.How accurate and generalizable are these predictions across different geographic and cultural markets?


### Installation Instructions
- How to set up the environment
- Link to requirements.txt
1. Open both notebook Data_Cleaning&EDA.ipynb which is first one and second Model_Training.ipynb in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
